The export consists of these tables:
  Persons        WCA competitors
  Competitions   WCA competitions
  Events         WCA events (Rubik's Cube, Megaminx, etc)
  Results        WCA results per competition+event+round+person
  RanksSingle    Best single result per competitor+event and ranks
  RanksAverage   Best average result per competitor+event and ranks
  Rounds         The round types (first, final, etc)
  Formats        The round formats (best of 3, average of 5, etc)
  Countries      Countries according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries
  Continents     Continents

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but the result values of
the Results table need some explanation:

- The result values are in fields value1-value5, best and average.
- Value -1 means DNF
- Value -2 means DNS
- Value 0 means "nothing", for example a best-of-3 has value4=value5=average=0
- Positive values depend on the event, see column "format" in Events.
  - Most events have format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - Format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used
    by "fewest moves" for number of moves.
  - Format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding not only the time
    but also the number of attempted and solved cubes. Writing the value in
    decimal it is interpreted like this:
      old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
      new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed
    Note that this is designed so that a smaller value means a better result.
